```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = this(0) // Auxiliary constructor
}
```
This code is not inherently buggy, but it hides a subtle issue.  The seemingly innocuous auxiliary constructor allows you to create instances of `MyClass` without explicitly providing a value for `x`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the value of `x` is crucial for the class's functionality, particularly if methods of `MyClass` rely on `x` having a specific non-zero value or are sensitive to its value being 0.
